This application was created in Elm language version 0.19.0
You can run this also offline in your browser by the html file if you have compiled the elm-source to js file.
Alternatively you can run the elm file off-line directly without compiling it on the local server with the command elm reactor.

The code is made according to the basic Elm-architecture.
